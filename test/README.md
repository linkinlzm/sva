# Bitdefender's Linux Ransomware (Linux.Encoder.1) Decrypter

More Info: http://labs.bitdefender.com/2015/11/linux-ransomware-debut-fails-on-predictable-encryption-key/

## How to
1. Hopefully you have NOT deleted any encrypted files  
2. Run sort_files.sh / > sorted.list to obtain a list of the encrypted files sorted by encryption time
    * Note: run sort_files.sh /path/to/vm/partition if the data was on a vm
3. Most importantly, obtain the first file in that list, be it X.encrypted (head -1 sorted.list)
4. Find the seed using ./decrypter.py -f /path/to/X.encrypted
5. If you have the seed you can safely decrypt the files. Run ./decrypter.py -s <seed> -l <sorted.list> -e <error.list>
6. Check decryption was correct and clean the ".encrypted" files on your own.
    * Note: Unfortunately, the ransomware does not preserve ownership (user/group), some things might get broken because of this.
7. If you have files still encrypted they will appear in the file you provided as <error.list>. You will need to redo steps 3) -> 6) using the <error.list> until no more files.

## Example
    bash decrypter/sort_files.sh  > sorted_list
    head -1 sorted_list
    $> ./d/home/user/.bash_logout.encrypted
    python decrypter/decrypter.py -f ./d/home/user/.bash_logout.encrypted
    $> [*] Seed: 1447255617
    python decrypter/decrypter.py -s 1447255617 -l sorted_list -e error_list
     
Output:

    ...
    [FAILED] ./d/usr/share/doc/mlocate/README.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/mlocate/TODO.Debian.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/readline-common/changelog.Debian.gz.encrypted
    [FAILED] ./d/usr/share/doc/readline-common/copyright.encrypted

    [*] recovered 7572 files
    [*] failed to recover (probably bad seed) 9424 files
    [*] 36 corrupted (probably truncated) files

## Handling failed/corrupted files
The example shows 9424 files that failed to recover. This is usually because the seed used for the failed files is different for some files due to time differences. You have to get the seed of the files that failed. This procedure might work to get those:
     
    head -1 error_list 
    $> ./d/home/README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt.encrypted
    python decrypter/decrypter.py -f ./d/home/README_FOR_DECRYPT.txt.encrypted
    $> [*] Seed: 1447255625
    python decrypter/decrypter.py -s 1447255625 -l error_list -e error_list2

Output:

    ...
    [FAILED] ./d/usr/share/doc/mlocate/changelog.gz.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/mlocate/NEWS.gz.encrypted
    [FAILED] ./d/usr/share/doc/mlocate/README.encrypted
    [FAILED] ./d/usr/share/doc/readline-common/copyright.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/readline-common/inputrc.arrows.encrypted
    [*] recovered 5000 files
    [*] failed to recover (probably bad seed) 4424 files
    [*] 0 corrupted (probably truncated) files


Repeat the above steps to get the remaining 4424 failed files:

    head -1 error_list2
    $> ./d/root/test/size_10028.encrypted
    python decrypter/decrypter.py -f ./d/root/test/size_10028.encrypted
    $> [*] Seed: 1447255634
    python decrypter/decrypter.py -s 1447255634 -l error_list2 -e error_list3

    ...
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/libsqlite3-0/changelog.html.gz.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/linux-image-2.6.32-5-amd64/changelog.Debian.gz.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/locales-all/copyright.encrypted

    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/mlocate/AUTHORS.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/mlocate/changelog.gz.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/mlocate/README.encrypted
    [OK] ./d/usr/share/doc/readline-common/copyright.encrypted
    [*] recovered 4424 files
    [*] failed to recover (probably bad seed) 0 files
    [*] 0 corrupted (probably truncated) files

DONE!
